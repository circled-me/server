# circled.me community server
This project aims to help people easily backup and share photos, videos, albums on their own server.
Upcoming releases will further enable you to share with your circles by including group chats and more...  

After certain services became paid some time ago, I have decided I'd rather be able host my own photos.
The main reason is, of course, privacy! This project has currently only one contributor, so help will be greatly appreciated üòä

Another focus of this project is having the ability to host everything a community needs to be able to communicate and exchange photos, ideas, etc.
I strongly believe in local/focused communities and sharing with the community, but at the same time - keeping everything private, within the community.
In my personal case, I share mostly photos with my family and close friends.

## Mobile app
The **circled.me** mobile app **works with multiple accounts and servers**. For example, you can have your family server and account, and your gaming/running/basketball comunities' accounts on the same app and being able to interact with all of them at the same time.
